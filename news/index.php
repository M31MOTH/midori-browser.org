			<h3><a href="http://twotoasts.de/index.php/2013/02/64-bit-windows-and-flashget/">64-bit Windows and FlashGet</a></h3>
			<p>Here we go with the Windows build <a href="http://twotoasts.de/index.php/2013/02/goulash-needs-to-cook-long-to-be-tasty/">following Midori 0.4.8</a>. For the first time, an experimental 64-bit version is available &#8211; no HTML5 video just yet. FlashGet is supported as an external download manager: just like on Linux and BSD, in the Preferences under the Extensions tab it can be activated.</p>
			<p>Again, portable mode is officially supported. The 7z versions include a &#8220;portable.bat&#8221; which runs Midori out of the folder. It can be copied to a USB stick and will keep all data in the &#8220;profile&#8221; folder in the same folder instead of storing files in the system user folder.</p>

			<p><img src="http://midoribrowser.org/images/news/midori.png" class="floatright"><img src="http://midoribrowser.org/images/news/midoriold.png" class="floatright"><img src="http://midoribrowser.org/images/news/midorioldest.png" class="floatright">elementary has always shipped our web browser with an elementary-designed icon, which didn't happen to match up with the official/upstream Midori logo. While it's worked well for us up until now, we've designed something better.</p>
			<p>The original/upstream logo, above, is supposed to be representative of the Midori name. It's a green M-like cat paw thing, and Midori means green or cat. However, it doesn't communicate anything about what the app does.</p>

			<p>Few things are better than kicking back on the couch and streaming your favourite album wirelessly to your stereo from your phone. That’s easy to do with AirPlay, but if you don’t want to pay for Apple’s solutions, a Raspberry Pi does the job remarkably well.</p>
			<p>&hellip;If you like, open up the Midori browser from the desktop&hellip;</p>

			<p>As the longest-established of the desktops we're looking at, you might expect Xfce to have the most complete set of tools, and it acquits itself well, with a native browser, Midori (available as part of the Xfce Goodies bundle), and a media player, Parole, which uses the GStreamer functionality. Xfce also includes a text editor, Mousepad, which is based on Leafpad.</p>
